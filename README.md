# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

This studyguide is meant to serve as a place to gather notes about the prework project. I built this to put together everything I learned about HTML, CSS, Git, and JavaScript. I wanted to have a place for all my notes and thus this studyguide helps me put all my content together in an organized fashion that can be shared with others. Throughout the process of creating this, I learned how to build a website using GitHub, how to write code using basic commands on Git Bash and using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript on VS Code.
